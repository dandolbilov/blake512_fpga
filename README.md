# blake512_fpga

FPGA implementation of BLAKE-512 (cryptographic hash function).

The project is unfinished in 2017.
Description (by memory):
- hardcoded input data length (80 bytes) and hardcoded padding
- it's not the fastest implementation (minimum of LUTs is preferable to speed)
- some Slacks to fix
